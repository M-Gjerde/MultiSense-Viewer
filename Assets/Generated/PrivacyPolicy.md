<h2>Disclosure of Information:</h2>

We do not disclose or sell any information we collect to third parties for any commercial purpose.

These service providers are required to keep the information confidential and are not authorized to use or disclose the information for any purpose other than providing services to us.
<h2>Security</h2>
We take reasonable measures to protect the anonymous information that we collect from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. However, no security measures are perfect or impenetrable, and we cannot guarantee the security of usage data or debug data.
